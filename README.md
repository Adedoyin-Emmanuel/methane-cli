}
```

To change the configurations, run the following command.

```

_jsx or tsx are the only options available_

#### Change Component Generation Style

To change the component generation style, run the following command.

```bash
doyin@doyinHpLaptop:~/Desktop/react-app$ methane-cli config -c arrow

```

_arrow or functional are the only options available_

#### Change Page Generation Style

To change the page generation style, run the following command

```bash
doyin@doyinHpLaptop:~/Desktop/react-app$ methane-cli config -p arrow

```

_arrow or functional are the only options available_

#### Generate Stylesheet

To generate stylesheet file for components and pages, run the following command

```bash
doyin@doyinHpLaptop:~/Desktop/react-app$ methane-cli config -gs true

```

_true or false are the only options available_

#### Generate Folder

To generate a folder for components and pages, run the following command

```

_true or false are the only options available_

#### Register Generated Pages

## Stuck :(

If you are stuck or you want to learn more about the different configurations, run the following command.

```bash
doyin@doyinHpLaptop:~/Desktop/react-app$ methane-cli c --help

```

## Create a Component ‚è≠.

```bash
doyin@doyinHpLaptop:~/Desktop/react-app$ methane-cli g -c componentName

```

This would create a new component according to the global configuration and add the component to the components folder in your react-app application.

#### Note:

_You don't have to be in your react-app components folder. you can run the command from the root folder of your react-application_

## Create a Page ‚è≠.

```bash
doyin@doyinHpLaptop:~/Desktop/react-app$ methane-cli g -c componentName

```

This would create a new page according to the global configuration and add the pages to the components pages in your react-app application. By default, a page generated comes with a **useNavigate()** hook and the **Link** tag.

#### Note:

_You don't have to be in your react-app pages folder. you can run the command from the root folder of your react-application_
Also, if you configure **methane-cli** to automatically import your pages, it would add the page once it is generated.

## Create a Service Worker ‚è≠.

```bash
doyin@doyinHpLaptop:~/Desktop/react-app$ methane-cli g -sw

```

This would create a service worker and add the service worker to the [index.js, main.js, index.jsx, main.jsx] or tsx respectively.

You can now register the service worker by adding

```javascript
serviceWorkerRegistration.register();
```

#### Note:

_You don't have specify any name for the service-worker_
