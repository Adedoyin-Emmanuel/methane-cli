## Stuck :(

If you are stuck or you want to learn more about the different configurations, run the following command.

```bash
doyin@doyinHpLaptop:~/Desktop/react-app$ methane c --help

```

## Create a Component ‚è≠

With the new update, you can generate **React** or **NextJS** server or client components. Intresting right üòÑ. But the commands are different.

### Generating A React Component

```bash
doyin@doyinHpLaptop:~/Desktop/react-app$ methane g -c componentName

```

### Generating A NextJS Component

```bash
doyin@doyinHpLaptop:~/Desktop/react-app$ methane g -nc componentName

```

**Optionally, you can specify your nextJs component to be a server or client component** To do this, Simply add the **ct** flag, then you can specify server or client omitting the **ct** would generate a client component by default.

The convention is that you've a component or components directory in your application. **Methane** would find that directory and then place your component in it.

#### Note

\_You don't have to be in your react-app components folder. You can run the command from the root folder of your react-application and that's infact how

## Create a Page ‚è≠

```bash
doyin@doyinHpLaptop:~/Desktop/react-app$ methane g -c componentName

```

This would create a new page according to the global configuration and add the pages to the components pages in your react-app application. By default, a page generated comes with a **useNavigate()** hook and the **Link** tag.

#### Note

_You don't have to be in your react-app pages folder. you can run the command from the root folder of your react-application_
Also, if you configure **methane-cli** to automatically import your pages, it would add the page once it is generated.

## Configurations ‚öôÔ∏è

Added a new command **`list-config [ls]`**

- `--list-config` or `-lc`: Lists all Methane configurations.

````bash
doyin@doyinHpLaptop:~/Desktop/react-app$ methane list-config

All configurations
{
  template: 'jsx',
  component: 'arrow',
  page: 'arrow',
  generateStylesheet: 'true',
  generateFolder: 'true',
  register: 'true',
  stylesheetType: 'css'
}

## Create a Service Worker ‚è≠.

```bash
doyin@doyinHpLaptop:~/Desktop/react-app$ methane g -sw

````

This would create a service worker and add the service worker to the [index.js, main.js, index.jsx, main.jsx] or tsx respectively.

You can now register the service worker by adding

```javascript
serviceWorkerRegistration.register();
```

#### Note

_You don't have specify any name for the service-worker_

### Architecture üõ†

`methane-cli` uses a `modular` architecture.It consists of different modules that perform specific tasks such as generating components, pages, and service worker files.
